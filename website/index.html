<h1 class="site-title">WarGame 2</h1>

<div class="container">

	<h2 class="site-motto">Kinda-Sorta Basic Benchmarking in Java</h2>

	<p>To run the WarGame:</p>
	<blockquote class="howto">
			java App
	</blockquote>

	This will run like so:
	<ol>
		<li>Priming phase: 60 seconds of games running in attempt to mitigate overhead of setup and to reach a stable speed</li>
		<li>Testing phase: Determine if the speed is within a <em>+/-</em>00.01% range, check in <em>(1/speed)</em> seconds</li>
		<li>Retesting phase: if the speed is <em>not</em> within the range, test again in (1/speed) seconds</li>
		<li>Results phase: display the results</li>
	</ol>

	<p>The WarGame program has three primary <em>settings</em>:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>Threads</em>: by default, the number of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=logical+cores">logical cores</a> available</li>
		<li><em>Confidence</em>: the change allowed during the testing phase, as a percentage. By default, <em>00.01%</em>.
			<p>For example, if the speed at the beginning of the testing phase is <em>.2345</em>, then the confidence range would be <br />
				0.23447655 &lt; <em>.2345</em> &lt; 0.23452345
			</p>
		</li>
		<li><em>Prime time</em>: by default, 60 seconds
			<p>Prime time allows the program to reach a period of stability before testing begins.

			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Modes</h3>
	<p>The WarGame has various modes: Help, Short and Interactive.</p>

	<h4>Short</h4>
	<blockquote class="howto">
			java App s
	</blockquote>
	<p>This mode will run the WarGame program with 1% confidence and a 10 second priming phase.</p>

	<h4>Interactive</h4>
	<blockquote class="howto">
			java App i
	</blockquote>
	<p>This mode will run the WarGame program with user specified settings, those being <em>threads</em>, <em>confidence</em> and <em>prime time</em>.</p>

	<h3>Backstory</h3>
	<div class="story">
		<p>When I was in tenth grade, I spent a week or so coding the original WarGame &mdash; a simulator for playing war. The sim was fine, but my favorite past time was running it on various computers with a <em>million games</em> to see how long it would end up taking. In 2012, I built a new computer with an incredibly fast processor and I needed something better to test it than my original WarGame.</p>

		<p>Thus, the WarGame 2 was made. The second generation WarGame is the same at its core -- the game of War simulating two people playing cards. But the advancements are in the details: multiple threads play simultaneously (or whatever is an approximate of that) and a testing method that scales based on hardware capabilities. Threading makes full use cores available while the scaling method used allows for some degree of precision and consistency between runs. A faster computer will run more games for longer to ensure that its speed isn't fooling anyone.</p>

		<hr />

		<p>A note on the <em>scaling</em> method; after a minute, we time a test for 1/speed at that instant. On a slow computer, this will be only be another second or so of extra time. On a fast computer (like mine, or maybe a server), this ends up being thirty extra seconds of time, per test. Because the program use a 00.01% confidence range, there are often many tests. If the speed at the instant is not within the <em>+/-</em>00.01% range, the test starts over again with another (1/speed) seconds of time. Total times around ten minutes are <em>not</em> unheard of.</p>
